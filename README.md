# fetch-google-contacts
Fetch the contacts from your Google Account

This repository is based on the tutorial at 25labs website:
http://25labs.com/import-gmail-or-google-contacts-using-google-contacts-data-api-3-0-and-oauth-2-0-in-php/ 

Note that:

1. The first thing you need to do is to create an application at your Google Developers Console (https://console.developers.google.com/project). Then copy the client id, client secret, redirect uri into your code.
2. I have hidden them in the code of the files: "index.php" and "oauth.php".
3. I have given the redirect uri as: "oauth.php", but you are free to give any other url of your choice.
